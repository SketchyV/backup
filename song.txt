I don't trust nobody
I don't even trust my mind
Losin' everybody
They can never take the grind
People always switchin' sides
People always hit my line
Never ask me how I'm doin'
They just wanna waste my time
So I don't hate nobody
Just stay up out my life

And I won't hurt nobody
So just stay up out my sights
People always hold me down
They just told me that I'd drown
When you livin' how I'm livin'
All these leeches come around

'Cause we don't trust nobody
We don't even trust our minds
Losin' everybody
From them drugs to suicide
I was always gettin' high
Never took a look outside
I was livin' in the dark
Thinkin' I would never shine
